# Python-Password-Generator
The Password Generator project is a Python script that generates passwords based on user input. It offers three levels of complexity: weak and strong, each providing different transformations of the input sentence to create unique passwords.

# Features:
```
Weak Level:
Replaces specific letters ('a' with '4', 's' with '5', 'i' with '1', 'e' with '3').
Example: Input "This is an example" → Output "T143"

Strong Level:
Replaces specific letters ('a' with '4', 's' with '5', 'i' with '1').
Adds special characters from a predefined set every one words.
Example: Input "This is an example" → Output "T!1@4#3$"
```

# Usage:
```
Users input a sentence of their choice.
They do not need to specify the level; the script generates passwords for all levels automatically.
Each password level offers a different approach to transforming the input sentence into a secure password.
```

# Purpose:
```
This project demonstrates basic string manipulation and conditional logic in Python.
It provides users with a tool to quickly generate passwords with varying levels of complexity, catering to different security needs.
It serves as a practical exercise in combining multiple functions and control structures to achieve desired output based on user preferences.
```

# Future Enhancements:
```
Addition of more password complexity levels or customization options.
Integration with graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
Implementation of password strength evaluation metrics to assess generated passwords.
```

# Conclusion:
The Password Generator project is a beginner-friendly Python script that showcases fundamental programming concepts while providing a practical utility for generating secure passwords. It empowers users to create strong passwords tailored to their security requirements effortlessly.
